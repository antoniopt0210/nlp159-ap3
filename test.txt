36	adjudicated	0	I give him curses, yet he gives me love. 
487	adjudicated	3	Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams; I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright, For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering streams, I trust to taste of truest Thisby's sight. 
457	adjudicated	0	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning. 
92	adjudicated	3	I must go seek some dew-drops here, And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits: I'll be gone; Our queen and all her elves come here anon. 
465	adjudicated	1	This lion is a very fox for his valour.
421	adjudicated	0	No, my noble lord; It is not for you: I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world; Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain, To do you service. 
42	adjudicated	1	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me: O! then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell. 
120	adjudicated	0	You do impeach your modesty too much, To leave the city, and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not; To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity. 
198	adjudicated	0	Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard.
384	adjudicated	1	Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When everything seems double. 
27	adjudicated	2	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, And ere a man hath power to say, 'Behold!' The jaws of darkness do devour it up: So quick bright things come to confusion. 
441	adjudicated	3	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this! But what see I? No Thisby do I see. O wicked wall! through whom I see no bliss; Curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me! 
396	adjudicated	0	Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice. 
307	adjudicated	0	You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services. Let her alone; speak not of Helena; Take not her part, for, if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it. 
365	adjudicated	3	Fairy king, attend, and mark: I do hear the morning lark. 
264	adjudicated	3	Lysander's love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light. Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know, The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so? 
239	adjudicated	0	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well. 
463	adjudicated	0	A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience. 
409	adjudicated	1	Joy, gentle friends! joy, and fresh days of love 
53	adjudicated	0	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver. 
20	adjudicated	1	Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes. 
206	adjudicated	0	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again: Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note; So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape; And thy fair virtue's force, perforce, doth move me, On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee. 
228	adjudicated	1	This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do? 
79	adjudicated	4	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all. 
484	adjudicated	0	Well moused, Lion. 
485	adjudicated	0	And then came Pyramus.
5	adjudicated	0	So is Lysander.
4	adjudicated	2	What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid. To you, your father should be as a god; One that compos'd your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. 
194	adjudicated	2	O!—As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire. 
357	adjudicated	0	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen. 
171	adjudicated	0	I fear it, I promise you. 
236	adjudicated	0	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
205	adjudicated	0	for indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so? 
58	adjudicated	4	That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split. 
468	adjudicated	0	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well: leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon. 
200	adjudicated	1	What do you see? you see an ass-head of your own, do you? 
258	adjudicated	0	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none: If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone. My heart with her but as guest wise sojourn'd, And now to Helen it is home return'd, There to remain. 
142	adjudicated	1	O! take the sense, sweet, of my innocence, Love takes the meaning in love's conference. I mean that my heart unto yours is knit, So that but one heart we can make of it; Two bosoms interchained with an oath; So then two bosoms and a single troth. Then by your side no bed-room me deny, For, lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. 
310	adjudicated	0	You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you: Nay, go not back. 
456	adjudicated	1	Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
318	adjudicated	0	Up and down, up and down; I will lead them up and down: I am fear'd in field and town; Goblin, lead them up and down. 
417	adjudicated	4	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play; But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious; for in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted. And tragical, my noble lord, it is; For Pyramus therein doth kill himself. Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess, Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed. 
149	adjudicated	0	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius. 
233	adjudicated	1	Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse. If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in knee deep, And kill me too. The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me. Would he have stol'n away From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon May through the centre creep, and so displease Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him; So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim. 
394	adjudicated	0	It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
375	adjudicated	0	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past: 
363	adjudicated	0	When thou wak'st, with thine own fool's eyes peep. 
229	adjudicated	0	I took him sleeping,—that is finish'd too,— And the Athenian woman by his side; That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd. 
404	adjudicated	0	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words: away! go; away. 
292	adjudicated	1	O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom! You thief of love! what! have you come by night And stol'n my love's heart from him?
261	adjudicated	3	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes; Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, It pays the hearing double recompense. Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found; Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound. But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? 
296	adjudicated	0	Lower! hark, again. 
203	adjudicated	1	The ousel-cock, so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill. 
157	adjudicated	1	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born? When at your hands did I deserve this scorn? Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency? Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo. But fare you well: perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness. O! that a lady of one man refus'd, Should of another therefore be abus'd. 
278	adjudicated	0	Quick, come! 
479	adjudicated	0	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe. 
56	adjudicated	0	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant? 
481	adjudicated	0	Well roared, Lion. 
419	adjudicated	0	Hard-handed men, that work in Athens here, Which never labour'd in their minds till now, And now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories With this same play, against your nuptial. 
26	adjudicated	1	O hell! to choose love by another's eye.
478	adjudicated	0	All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog. 
73	adjudicated	0	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother. Tom Snout, the tinker. 
101	adjudicated	14	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravished? And make him with fair Ægle break his faith, With Ariadne, and Antiopa? 
209	adjudicated	0	Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. 
423	adjudicated	0	I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharg'd, And duty in his service perishing. 
167	adjudicated	14	Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear. 
39	adjudicated	0	The more I love, the more he hateth me. 
241	adjudicated	3	A privilege never to see me more. And from thy hated presence part I so; See me no more, whe'r he be dead or no. 
467	adjudicated	0	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose. 
125	adjudicated	1	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. We cannot fight for love, as men may do; We should be woo'd and were not made to woo. 
34	adjudicated	0	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still. 
341	adjudicated	0	Scratch my head, Pease-blossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb? 
361	adjudicated	0	Silence, awhile. Robin, take off this head. Titania, music call; and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense. 
178	adjudicated	0	Yes, it doth shine that night. 
294	adjudicated	1	Puppet! why, so: ay, that way goes the game. Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures: she hath urg'd her height; And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him. And are you grown so high in his esteem, Because I am so dwarfish and so low? How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak; How low am I? I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes. 
446	adjudicated	0	My love! thou art my love, I think. 
491	adjudicated	0	O! wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear? Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer. 
347	adjudicated	0	What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love? 
232	adjudicated	0	O! why rebuke you him that loves you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
448	adjudicated	14	And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill. 
271	adjudicated	0	Stay, gentle Helena! hear my excuse: My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena! 
291	adjudicated	0	Ay, by my life; And never did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt; Be certain, nothing truer: 'tis no jest, That I do hate thee and love Helena. 
329	adjudicated	3	For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite. 
28	adjudicated	1	If then true lovers have been ever cross'd, It stands as an edict in destiny: Then let us teach our trial patience, Because it is a customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers. 
462	adjudicated	0	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam: For, if I should as lion come in strife Into this place, 'twere pity on my life. 
161	adjudicated	0	Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke. 
136	adjudicated	0	Hence, away! now all is well. One aloof stand sentinel. 
342	adjudicated	0	Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get your weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and, good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustard-seed? 
373	adjudicated	0	It is, my lord. 
253	adjudicated	0	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. 
2	adjudicated	0	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke! 
368	adjudicated	1	Go, one of you, find out the forester; For now our observation is perform'd; And since we have the vaward of the day, My love shall hear the music of my hounds. Uncouple in the western valley; let them go: Dispatch, I say, and find the forester. We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction. 
246	adjudicated	7	I go, I go; look how I go; Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow. 
113	adjudicated	0	Having once this juice I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing then she waking looks upon, Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey, or on busy ape, She shall pursue it with the soul of love: And ere I take this charm off from her sight, As I can take it with another herb, I'll make her render up her page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible, And I will overhear their conference. 
91	adjudicated	3	Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander every where, Swifter than the moone's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green: The cowslips tall her pensioners be; In their gold coats spots you see; Those be rubies, fairy favours, In their freckles live their savours: 
60	adjudicated	0	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling. 
218	adjudicated	0	I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I out my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name, honest gentleman? 
86	adjudicated	10	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. But masters, here are your parts; and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night, and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight: there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not. 
348	adjudicated	0	I have a reasonable good ear in music: let us have the tongs and the bones.
134	adjudicated	0	You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen; Newts, and blind-worms, do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen. Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby: Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby: Never harm, Nor spell, nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby.
